The smoothie is made by blending the juices of these fruits, typically at room temperature, and then adding a small amount of water. The smoothie is then stirred to combine the flavors and textures of the ingredients. Fruit smoothie is a great choice for those looking for a healthy and satisfying snack, especially during a busy lifestyle.
